# AI-Powered Math Question Generator

An intelligent system for automatically generating high-quality, context-aware, university-level math exam questions. Designed to support both general subjects (e.g. Probability for Mathematics) and domain-specific topics (e.g. Statistics for Mechanical Engineering), the system assists instructors by saving time, increasing question diversity, and enhancing educational efficiency.

##  Features

- **Multi-domain support**: Tailors questions to subjects like engineering, mathematics, and more.
- **Multi-agent RAG architecture**: Retriever, Generator, and Validator agents work collaboratively using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- **LLM-powered generation**: Uses local large language models (like Mistral) for generation.
- **Instructor input support**: Accepts course materials and example questions to guide generation.
- **Real-time status**: WebSocket-based updates for generation progress.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Instructors can review, approve, or edit generated questions.
- **Database integration**: Stores questions, logs, and vector embeddings in a structured DB.
